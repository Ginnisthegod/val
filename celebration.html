            <h2>My Dearest Bisola,</h2>
            <p>
                Every day I wake up grateful that God brought you into my life. 
                You are truly the beauty of God, and your smile lights up my entire world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want you to know that I'm working hard every single day, not just for me, 
                but for us. I'm building a future where I can give you everything you deserve 
                and more. You inspire me to be better, to push harder, and to never give up.
            </p>
            <p>
                My love, you deserve the absolute best, and I promise you that I'm committed 
                to making sure you have it. Every sacrifice, every late night prayers, every challenge 
                I face is worth it because it's all for you, for us, for our future together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for believing in me, for standing by me, and for saying yes to being 
                my Valentine. You make everything worthwhile.
            </p>
